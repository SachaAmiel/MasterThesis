Section 1: Axiomatic approach to QFT
    Details:
    - Start with axioms,
    - Go into how basic conepts of QFT are formalized (maybe not all of them thought... I guess this part's size will depend how much space is left in the thesis)
    - Manage to transision from axioms to basic formulae (and start talking about Hadamard States)
    (-) Finish on the notion of two identical physics on different spacetime and the possibility of excluding whizmical spacetimes

Section 2: Energy Condition (classically)
    Details:
    - Folowing from transition, explain the idea of adding "physical" conditions to exclude whimzica spacetimes.
    - Classical Energy conditions (the basis)
    - Famous application: Penrose's Theorem

Section 3: Quantum Energy conditions
    Details:
    - Show them (and explain how they are the Q equivalent of ECond)
    - Emphasis on the state, back on the Hadamard state, (I'm thinking more about renormalization schemes of Had states... But that might also be a good spot to introduce non-state independant ECond... To see with Eleni)
    - Maybe finish on my actual work... If I manage to do any in time.

In the apendix (thanks to Fil Chernikov for the idea), have two identical apendix, except one is pure math, and the other is pure physics. That way, anyting in the apendix, I can just quote without fear of being miss-understood, and anyone that doesn't understand either the meaning or the structure can just go and read whatever they are having issues with.
